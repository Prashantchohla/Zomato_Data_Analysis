# Zomato_Data_Analysis

Project Overview: Advanced SQL Problem-Solving with Zomato Data
This project demonstrates my expertise in SQL by analyzing and solving complex business challenges for Zomato, one of India's leading food delivery platforms. The project covers the end-to-end process of database creation, data cleaning, and insightful problem-solving using advanced SQL techniques.

riders.csv: Rider information, including assignments and performance.
restaurants.csv: Restaurant details, such as location, opening time.
customers.csv: Customer demographics and behavioral data.
deliveries.csv: Delivery metrics, including times.

Database Schema:
All data was structured and cleaned using SQL scripts stored in the zomato_schema.sql file.
The schema includes optimized relationships and constraints for seamless query execution.
Problem Statements

A detailed list of business challenges, framed as SQL problems, is provided in the Zomato Advanced Business Problems.pdf file.
These problems simulate real-world decision-making scenarios such as:
